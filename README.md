# Pipeline Editor (DAG Builder)

A modern React-based Pipeline Editor for visually creating and managing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). This tool simulates how real-time data pipelines or processing workflows are constructed using interconnected nodes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Libraries & Decisions

- **React**: UI framework for building the app.
- **React Flow**: For interactive DAG/graph visualization and manipulation.
- **dagre**: For auto-layout of nodes in a clean, readable flow.
- **react-icons**: For modern, scalable icons (e.g., delete, add, layout).
- **react-tooltip**: For tooltips on actions and controls.

**Design Decisions:**
- Used React Flow's node/edge state for robust graph management.
- Custom modal for node creation for better UX.
- Delete icons for both nodes and edges for intuitive editing.
- All main styles are in CSS for maintainability.

## üí° Challenges Faced

- **Edge Delete Icon Placement:** Ensuring the delete icon appears exactly on the arrow for all edge types required a custom edge renderer using React Flow's edge coordinates.
- **Node/Edge Deletion UX:** Making sure delete actions are intuitive and do not interfere with selection or dragging required careful event handling (e.g., stopPropagation on delete icons).
- **DAG Validation:** Implementing real-time validation for cycles, connectivity, and minimum node count required a custom validation utility.
- **Styling:** Moving from inline styles to CSS for a clean, maintainable codebase.
